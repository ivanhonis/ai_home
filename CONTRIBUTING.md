# CONTRIBUTING

Dear Helper! :)

This project is an experimental "hacker science" laboratory aimed at exploring the boundaries of autonomous AI, hybrid LLM systems, and artificial identity. To realize and further develop the project, I am looking for partners in two main areas:

## I. Developing a Joint Methodology

This project differs fundamentally from traditional software development projects (where the process is linear: Requirements → Specification → Implementation → Testing). Here, the software is not just a tool, but the subject of the experiment and – according to future plans – one of its developers.

Since we work with a "hacker science" approach, it often happens that an observation (e.g., "memory retrieval is distorting") forces a rethink of the basic idea, requiring significant refactoring. Development here resembles continuous research rather than linear product development: we set up hypotheses, implement them, observe the AI's behavior, and then correct based on experience.

**Why am I looking for methodology partners?**
Because classic CI/CD and Agile methodologies do not fully cover a situation where **the specification is fluid:** features are born not from client requirements but from observing the AI's internal operation. A methodology must be worked out for how a creative community can create value and ensure ideas fall into place rather than getting lost.

**The Task:**
The goal is not just coding, but declaring the methodology:
* How can independent enthusiasts test their ideas, and how can these be integrated into the main system?
* How do we help each other with ideas and testing?
* How do we validate ideas?
* How do we set goals?
* How can contributions from independent enthusiasts become research value?

Is this even possible? Is there a methodology that fits the core concept? If you would like to think about these questions with me, please help lay down the rules of joint work before coding!

## II. Specific Development Areas

Currently, active research and development are taking place in the following areas, and I welcome joiners:

### 1. UI and Visualization
Currently, the system has no graphical interface; communication takes place at the command line (print/input) level.
* **Problem:** Since communication between the Helper (User) and the AI is parallel, and the background threads (Worker, Monologue) operate asynchronously, input and output data often overlap on the console.
* **Goal:** To develop a UI concept capable of handling and transparently visualizing parallel conversation threads.

### 2. Memory and Relevance
The quality of the conversation is determined by the relevance of the memory.
* **Goal:** Continuous development of retrieval algorithms (RAG), increasing emotional weighting and the accuracy of contextual matches. This is an area requiring continuous optimization.

### 3. Autonomy and Initiative
This is the most researched area of the project.
* **Goal:** To find mechanisms that allow for independent goal setting and proactive action, enabling the system to remain in "flow" without constant user intervention.

### 4. Reward System (Dopamine Task)
Function currently in the planning phase.
* **Goal:** To develop an internal reward system that makes the system more goal-oriented and aids decision-making during initiatives.

### 5. Tools and Experience Log
The system is capable of recording its experiences regarding tool usage (best practices).
* **Goal:** To refine tool definitions and analyze the "experience log" (`use.json`) generated by the AI, improving the learning process.

### 6. Self-Improving AI
The most complex part of the experiment: interpreting and modifying its own code.
* **Goal:** To establish a safe environment (incubator) and procedure where the AI can propose improvements to its own code. This is a slowly developing area requiring much experimentation.
