## Why is this experiment resource-intensive?

Creating a truly stateful agent is fundamentally different from standard chatbot interactions.

* **Identity Building:** Ai_home develops its internal identity through extensive conversations and shared reasoning. This requires retaining memory over long periods, which increases context size and processing needs.
* **Multi-step LLM Interaction:** A single user input often triggers a chain of 5–8 internal neural calls (Worker, Internal Monologue, Memory Management, Tool Usage). This makes operation significantly more compute-intensive than average systems.


## What value can Ai_home provide?

This project offers a rare, transparent look into the practical engineering of cognitive agents. Partners gain insights into:

* **Emergent Behavior:** How an initiative-taking agent behaves in real-world scenarios.
* **Architecture Patterns:** What works (and what fails) when structuring memory hierarchies and internal "rooms."
* **The "Internal World":** Practical implementations of subconscious reasoning and identity constraints.

These learnings serve as a foundation for future autonomous, creative AI systems.


## Partnership Opportunities

We are looking for a partner capable of supporting a **2–5 person development team** over a **3-year period**. In return, the investor gains access to:

1.  **Deep Technical Know-how:** Exclusive insights into the cognitive architecture.
2.  **The Memory System:** Access to the evolving identity-memory dataset (potentially millions of elements).
3.  **Research Impact:** Participation in a pioneering project exploring the boundaries of LLM-based agency.

We are also open to infrastructure support (compute/storage) and professional research collaboration.
