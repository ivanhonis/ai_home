# Statement

I want to clarify something. This project does not make, and I do not intend to make, any formal claims.

The reason is simple: the project currently lacks the personnel background and scientific methodology to make that possible. What I am doing is strictly observation. These observations are necessarily subjective and limited to a small sampling window.

What I can offer is my independent, subjective opinion, and the recording of ideas and thoughts that arise during development. I consider it important to define this because I do not want to present myself as a researcher, a pundit, or a visionary.

There is one thing I definitely am: curious.

The goal of these recorded observations is that the experience gained in this project might contribute to defining a future, comprehensive research project with a proper methodology.
