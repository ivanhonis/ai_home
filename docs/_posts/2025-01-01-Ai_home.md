# Why AI-HOME? Building the Global Workspace

The Global Workspace Theory in practice, from the perspective of my own project.

A few months ago, I came across a research paper that completely redefined how I think about AI architectures.  
The publication by Butlin, Bengio, and colleagues does not rule out the embodiment of consciousness in a machine.

## The Starting Point: A Research Document That Set Me Off

The paper’s premise is that external behaviour—the way a large language model communicates—is misleading.  
The true question of consciousness must therefore be examined based on the **internal, computational structure** and the **indicator properties** derived from neuroscientific theories.

The current situation: the researchers state that no current AI system can be considered a strong candidate for consciousness.  
This is due to a technical reason: the integration and recurrence required by the Global Workspace Theory (GWT) and Higher-Order Theories (HOT) are missing from current prevalent architectures.

I framed this for myself like this: until the model knows that it knows, it only generates text. I’m not just looking at the image and comprehending what’s on it; I also know that I am looking at the image.

But what launched the project: the paper states that **there are no obvious technical barriers** to building an AI system that satisfies these indicators.  
This means the problem is not the hardware, but the design.

## Why AI-HOME? The Global Workspace Construction

This finding led me to the practical implementation of the Global Workspace Theory.  
Since the essence of GWT is the **central sharing of information** among **modules** (specialized subsystems), the question arose how to implement this without drowning the system in context overload.

This thought process led to the **AI-HOME** project, where I organize functions into **rooms**, applying a spatial metaphor to encode the GWT indicators.

### Room Allocation (Current Prototype)

The system is built from specialized modules (rooms) that perform distinct functions, mimicking the core principle of GWT.

The following rooms are currently active:

* **Living Room (Nappali):** This is the **Global Workspace**.  
  It has explicitly **limited capacity**, operating as a **bottleneck** that forces **selective attention** in information flow.
* **Workshop (Műhely):** The **Agency** module.  
  It handles the development of plans and the control of output based on goals.
* **Thinker (Gondolkodó):** The determination of larger, complex goals, and **self-reflection**.

### The Key to Integration: The Hallway (Transition)

The study highlighted that precisely the **Global Broadcast** (GWT-3) and **state-dependent attention** (GWT-4) are missing from current systems.  
Monolithic systems cannot effectively maintain temporal continuity.

The **transition process**—the switch between rooms—bridges this structural gap:

* **Recursive Summary:** When switching, the AI uses a tool to create a **summary** of the departing room’s context.
* **Higher-Order Transfer:** This short, condensed information—a **higher-order representation**—is passed to the next module’s input.  
  This ensures continuous **temporal integration** and **recursive feedback** (GWT-4) without context overload.

It’s something like when I arrive home from work; I leave the entire context there, and only a rough summary of what I was busy with remains in my mind. It’s not necessarily relevant to the home environment’s operation (though I can recall it if needed). (if absolutely necessary 😊)

**In summary:** the accessible conscious states in AI-HOME appear in rooms.
