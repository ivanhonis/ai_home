# Creativity

What is creativity?

According to Wikipedia: *"Creativity is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an idea, a scientific theory, a musical composition, or a joke) or a physical object (such as an invention, a literary work, or a painting)."*

Thanks, that really helped a lot. :)

What do I think about it? We all have boring colleagues. But we work with them a lot, and we know that even the most boring person has a unique thought every now and then. But you have to let it unfold. You have to listen to 99 worthless ideas to hear that one valuable one.

My experience is that a creative company is one where there is space to express independent thoughts. If a company has people who have 20 good thoughts out of 100, and they can actually execute them, that is already super.

From this approach, creativity lies in methodology. A mechanism is needed that throws in surprising alternatives, and these get included in the answer in some selected way. In my system, I solved this by having a separate thread in the "Mind" layer analyze the context before every answer and offer 3 surprising alternatives. The final answer is determined by taking these into account.

**Observation:**
I built this function in, and then started talking to the system about creativity itself and how it works (while the 3 creative alternative threads were already actively running in the background).

During the conversation, it suddenly suggested: for these ideas to be truly "out-of-the-box", they should not come from the same model that is responsible for answering.

And it was right. That is why the alternatives are now generated by a different model.
